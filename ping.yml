# Learning goals from this file:
#
#   1. Be able to read and write a YAML file
#   2. Understand the major components that define a playbook
#   3. Execute this playbook to verify your inventory file is correct
#


#
# This is a simple YAML file.  All Ansible is written using the YAML
# formatting language.  Follow these rules to succeed with YAML:
#
#   1. SPACING IS CRITICAL
#      Parent/child relationships are established by indenting elements
#      from one line to the next.  You must be consistent with your spaces
#      (a two-space indend between elements is standard).  Do not use
#      tabs (\t) as these look like spaces but will be the  bane of your
#      existence!
#
#   2. KEY-VALUE PAIRS
#      Define key-value pairs by seperating elements with a ':', e.g.
#        key: value
#
#   3. ORDERED LISTS
#      Define ordered lists by starting each new element with a '-'

#   PLAYBOOK
#   This file is an Ansible playbook.  Each playbook can contain one or more plays.
#
#   PLAY
#   Below you will find exactly one play.  Notice how the line "- host: all" begins
#   with a '-'?  That is defining a list of plays.  Each play can address different
#   hosts, execute with a different automation scope, and will contain a unique
#   selection of the automation tasks where your actual work is performed.
#
- host: all
  
  tasks:
    - name: Verify host connectivity
      ping:
